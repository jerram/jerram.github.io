Log of the trip with [DIY Sound System](http://diyhifi.biz/) to [Olympic Dam SA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Dam_mine) for the June 30 [Lizard Bites Back](https://lizardbitesback.net/) ([photos](https://lizardbitesback.net/photos-from-the-lizard-bites-back/)) anti-Uranium / water rights Protestival.

Met Phil at my place after work, left just before 8p with telescope packed onto the roof. After getting out of the city everything was pretty shut and we just kept pushing on. Phil's new Forester ran very well, talking things over  what had been happening since our last trips out to the desert in 1999 and 2000, trying to work out cruise control with no status lights.

Using lots of fuel at 110km/h with a load on the roof.

```
34.4L for 279km
280/35=7km/l
```

Went through lots of small towns, ([Whycheproof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wycheproof) what's in a name) first stop [Lake Tyrrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tyrrell) outside Sea Lake, 350km from Melbourne at 1am under a tree. Chilly.


Things I did not bring:

- *Pillow*. If you have a down jacket you can roll this up into its hood for a feather pillow.
- *Camp chair*
- *Digital level* for the telescope
- *A cup*. Luckily Phil had picked me up a Pingu cup, that kids kept on knicking at out Roxby camp.
- *Jet stove and flint*
- *Washing up tub and detergent*
- *Folding table*. This makes a big difference to the quality of sand in your cooking.
- *Usb car radio transmitter*

This is [The Warehouse](http://m.realcommercial.com.au/property-industrial+warehouse-vic-brunswick-501116079) I want to look up when I get back. Currently my shed is full of [The Motor](/pano), I figure if I rent out the spare room I can afford the rent on a larger space.

Ran into Monkey and Kim before Mildura. Kim was just over from Thailand and would prove to be a wild cook plus a serious startup discourse tactician. Went to Mildura for a camp chair, new water drum tap and bluetooth music dongle. Had a cheese and bacon meat pie and chocolate milk for breakfast, very Australian.

Driving at 100km/h now:

```
42.32L @ 599km Mildura
320/42.32 = 8km/l
```

Flat flat land, straight roads. Theme music is Leftfield. Less talking. All the stuff that occupies your mind day to day starts to fall away. Passed an ILS [instrument landing system](http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/56165840.jpg). This is what I miss being a info worker - my mind is continuously focused, I always have to think about what is at hand. When I used to do manual labor, you had hours and hours a week to think about things while you moved your hands and legs.

I'm wearing my old beat up uggs, taking them out for a last trip before hopefully a ceremonial burning. *Ugg boots trip topics:*

- *Final Furry Hurrah*
- *Ugg Primal Scream*
- *Shoe Deathchant*
- *Kicking the Bucket List*

Saw an add for [Northwest 3 day endouro motorx](https://www.northwestvicmcc.com.au/round-3-enduro-update/). That would be serious fun.

*Notes only from here:*

- Burra predominately light stone houses, no wood?

Filled up, we have been doing 90km/h to stop the car kicking down into 3rd gear in the headwind.

```
44.2L @ 962 @ Burra
463/44.2 = 10km/L
```

Did around 600kms today. Saw a giant wind turbine blade in [Mount Bryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Bryan,_South_Australia).

## Port Augusta

shopping mostly dry food 200 plus 2 x 16gb micro sd cards for go pro.

```
35L @ 1200 @ Port Augusta
238 / 35L = 6.8km/l hills around Peterbourgh?
```

Heading north to Pimba following Marc and Kim with the DIY Hifi trailer.

Cops stopped everyone 200kms from Port Disgusta and searched us. Apparently the sniffer dog could smell pot on my pants, so they went through all my gear with a fine tooth comb even though I said there was nothing there.

Get the shipping container and drop it on the land. Cost the transport.

**Everyone needs to keep on paying.**
Not buying paying.
You have to keep paying for all the other people to do their shit.
Buy a car, pay a person to make a car.
Go second hand, you are not paying to keep it going any longer.
If everyone stopped paying would the ride stop?

**If I did everything right, how life would lead.** I know what it is, I just choose not to do it. Exercise. Save all my money. Don't have a credit card. Be awesome. Don't smoke or drink or stay up late. Make sandwiches for work. Sleep right. Do all the projects.

- Matt who is like uncle Matt.
- Vance & Sophia with the white ute heading to Alice to see his sister.

## Leaving day.

Kim is playing violin and cooking more amazing food. Defo going to keep looking at the long tail with this smart girl. Heading back with Izzyosyncratic and Bassy in defected vehicle with unregistered trailer and no licensed drivers. What could go wrong.

- Add lights - flashing lights - to the telescope when it is moving. Like a red flashing space viewing robot.
- Jarrod who brought the bush dunnys, what a legend.
- Charlotte and James and Terra, hadnt seen Charlotte since 2000 in WA. Amazing to see her, and meet her family.

## Hot springs

Heading back with Izzy Lombe and Bassy, Sombwah and Rusty the dog. Left super late after going to the hot springs. Lindhurst shop had shut by 6, so we are low on petrol. Driving at night heading for Zenis. Hit a roo and broke the light before Copley. Need a servo for fuel. Finally stopped to wait for morning to buy petrol. Late night anyway, time to stop.

Left earlyish, pies for breaky again. Broke trailer suspension and fixed it with a block of wood. Drove most of the day, didn't get pulled over.

Burra crazy cook-a-burra burgers for lunch. No fuel for bendigo, stopping at truckstop 11pm.

- Groundsheet for going under and over swag on the wet.
