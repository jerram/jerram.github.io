Mid Jan, finally raining after a spring and half summer of no rain. Hopefully will reduce the risk of more fires here this season. Garden is going well, need to get some photos up for the garden this season.

Work is Smart Safety Solutions, getting some gardening and shed time as well, working on the [Telescope](/telescope/).
