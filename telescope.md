This is the telescope. I bought it second hand off a guy in Melbourne years ago, and have used it a fair bit, backyards, sidewalk nights, took it out to Lake Eyre, and more recently with the North Coast Astronomy Club here in the Byron Hinterland.

Few things I'm working on:

- Camera [Svbony205](https://www.amazon.com/SVBONY-Astronomy-Compact-Wide-angle-Astrophotography/dp/B075K18YBY)
- Laser - its a green hunting laser with a rifle mount and some double sided tape
- SkyFi - this is what I used to burn out the second-to-last motherboard that existed on the planet. Will RTFM before plugging it back in again
- Trolley. Yeah its heavy and I do think about having a smaller scope a lot. Perhaps a better trolley will help reduce the fiction to getting this out more often

## Camera

Astrophotography seems to be very Windows based. Being on a Mac I will be trying out a few different apps.
